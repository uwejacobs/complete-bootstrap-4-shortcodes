        [card-header]<span class="large"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-2x mr-2 fa-expeditedssl"></i> SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate</span>[/card-header]
        [card-body]
<p>Today's online shoppers are savvy about online security. Before completing a transaction or sharing personal information via online forms with you, online visitors need to know that your website can be trusted. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Certificates provide a visual indicator that your website is legitimate and secure.</p>
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/browser-bar-lock.png" alt="browser bar with closed lock">
<p>By default, all iFastNet powered websites include a free Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate that provides the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) required to protect any part of your website where a customer may enter sensitive information. The certificate is valid for 90-days and will automatically renew for the next 90 days.</p>
<p><u>Seals</u></p>
<p>Premium SSL Certificates come with a trust seal that you can place on your website. It proved to increase visitor confidence and customer conversions. With Google and other major web browsers pushing the entire web towards HTTPS, Let’s Encrypt is ideal for taking the first step into the world of HTTPS. Let’s Encrypt is a great choice for smaller sites and blogs but it does not offer any site seals. Enterprise-level sites that handle sensitive data benefit from a premium SSL Certificate. For an e-commerce platform or any business that takes online payment directly, the safety of your customer data is crucial – something for which you’ll always want to ensure the maximum level of security and protection. While Let’s Encrypt can provide SSL protection, it can’t offer the comprehensive coverage and reliability provided by a premium SSL Certificate.</p>
<p>We usually install the Let's Encrypt certificate but can help with a Trust Site Seal if deemed necessary by you.</p>

        [card-body]
<p>We design the websites in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress Content Management System</a> that provides content control of all parts of the website. WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as Themes. As one of the most popular content management system solutions in use, WordPress is installed on 43% of the top 10 million websites as of October 2021. The WordPress plugin architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website. As of December 2021, WordPress.org has over 55,000 plugins available, each of which offers custom functions and features that enable users to tailor their sites to their specific needs.
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
</p><p>WK Wow is a beautiful, attractive, and free WordPress theme. The theme can be used as the framework for all kinds of personal and professional websites. Its design and layout make it perfect to showcase your articles. This theme is based on Bootstrap 4 and adapts beautifully to all screen sizes. It is also compatible with WooCommerce and Contact Form 7. </p>

<p>These ready-to-use plugins - some installed on thousands of other websites - have been carefully selected by us and cut down on developing and testing time. Several plugins also come in a paid-for Pro version, but the standard version is usually sufficient to get started.</p>
<p><strong>User Account</strong></p>
<p>We create one WordPress user account with the Editor role. This allows someone without a web developer background to maintain parts of the website.</p>

    [card class="mb-3 border-bottom"]
        [card-header]<span class="large"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-2x mr-2 fa-google"></i> Google Account</span>[/card-header]
        [card-body
<p>]We create a Google account with the login yourdomain@gmail.com or something similar, subject to availability. The account will be used to register your business listings and analytics accounts whenever they allow a Google login. This way, we do not need your credentials during web development and you have fewer credentials to deal with.</p>

        [card-header]<span class="large"><i class="fas fa-fw fa-2x mr-2 fa-store"></i> Business Profiles</span>[/card-header]
        [card-body]
<p>Local search engines promote a business location in proximity to the searcher as well as its reputation and core details. This new form of local optimization was born as a result of major search engines such as Google, Microsoft Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo, to name of few.</p>
<p>We will register your business with Google My Business, Microsoft Bing Places, and Yelp and enter your basic business information. We also upload your logo plus some pictures.</p>
<p>Sometimes, these listings already exist but haven't been claimed yet. In this case, we will take over the listing on your behalf. Google and Microsoft verify ownership by sending a postcard with a code to the business address. Once this code is entered at the listing, the business is verified and shows up in searches.</p>

        [card-header]<span class="large"><i class="fas fa-fw fa-2x mr-2 fa-share-square"></i> Social Media</span>[/card-header]
        [card-body]
<p>We will create a Facebook Business Page for you and enter the basic business information. It is not a separate Facebook account but a page where the assigned user roles govern the access level. Your personal Facebook accounts are added as admins and allow you to maintain everything on the page. An admin can choose to interact with the page as the page owner (the standard) or with his personal account.</p>
<p>Then we will create the Instagram account for the business and link it to the Facebook page. </p>

        [card-header]<span class="large"><i class="fas fa-fw fa-2x mr-2 fa-chart-line"></i> Analytics and Performance</span>[/card-header]
        [card-body]
<p>We will create the Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and Bing Webmaster accounts for your business and connect them to the website.</p>
<p><u>Google Tag Manager</u></p>
<p>Google Tag Manager is a tag management system (TMS) that allows you to quickly and easily update measurement codes and related code fragments collectively known as tags on your website or mobile app. Once the small segment of Tag Manager code has been added to your project, you can safely and easily deploy analytics and measurement tag configurations from a web-based user interface.</p>
<p>When Tag Manager is installed, your website or app will be able to communicate with the Tag Manager servers. You can then use Tag Manager's web-based user interface to set up tags, establish triggers that cause your tag to fire when certain events occur, and create variables that can be used to simplify and automate your tag configurations.</p>
<p>A collection of tags, triggers, variables, and related configurations installed on a given website or mobile app is called a container. A Tag Manager container can replace all other manually-coded tags on a site or app, including tags from Google Ads, Google Analytics, Floodlight, and 3rd party tags. </p>

<p><u>Google Analytics</u></p>
<p>Google Analytics is an enterprise-class web analytics solution that gives you rich insights into your website traffic and marketing effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The creation of Google Analytics goals and reports is not part of the standard proposal but it is important to capture these metrics from day 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the data you need, organized in the way you want to see it with custom reports.</li>
<li>Reports can be scheduled for delivery via email, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.</li>
<li>Complete campaign tracking capabilities.</li>
<li>Mobile Tracking - Track mobile websites, mobile apps, and web-enabled mobile devices, including both high-end and non-JavaScript-enabled phones.</li>
<li>Understand visitor intent, find out what your customers are looking for and speed up time to conversion.</li>
<li>Data Export - Export your data with the Google Analytics Data Export API or email and export your data directly from the Google Analytics interface into Excel, CSV, PDF, and tab-delimited files.</li>

<p><u>Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools</u></p>
<p>Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools are web services that allow webmasters to check indexing status and optimize the visibility of their websites.</p>
<p>The service includes tools that let webmasters</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit and check a sitemap.</li>
<li>Check the crawl rate and view statistics about when Googlebot or BingBot accesses a particular site.</li>
<li>Write and check a robots.txt file to help discover pages that are blocked accidentally.</li>
<li>List internal and external pages that link to the website.</li>
<li>Get a list of links that Googlebot or BinfBot had difficulty crawling, including the that the bot received when accessing the URLs in question.</li>
<li>See what keyword searches on Google or Microsoft led to the site being listed on the results page plus the total clicks, total impressions, and the average click-through rates of such listings.</li>

<p>Google offers reCAPTCHA v2 and v3 to help you protect your sites from fraudulent activities, spam, and abuse. We will create the keys for both versions and connect them to your website. The reCATCHA is then placed on all pages with user submittable forms. The user only sees a small badge, and the verification happens in the background.</p>

<p>Custom web site design includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom design of the outer framework (e.g. header and footer) that is common on all web pages</li>
<li>Custom design of the page content (site map with inner detail pages):
  <ul>
    <li>Home Page (with map, image slider and newsletter subscription form)</li>

        [card-body]
<p>All pages are carefully optimized with code, keywords, and features that target a search engine’s ranking requirements and the keywords a consumer will use when they search locally for a product or service. And looking to the future of the Mobile-Web, all location pages are embedded with Geo-Metatags that specify a location’s “ICBM” address using latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>
<p>We apply unique metadata to pages, products, articles, and events. Metadata is structured information hidden behind your web pages within the source code. It describes the website content on your web pages in a structured way. Metadata primarily consists of basic descriptive text, keywords, and dates that help search engines determine who you are and how to index your web property. WordPress is designed to apply unique metadata for anything published, in an effort for all site content to get indexed and not just the home page.</p>

        [card-body]
<p>Every search engine provider uses crawlers to scan the internet for website content using the XML sitemap protocol. This sitemap informs the search engines exactly what to index so that their “spiders” don’t have to guess which pages contain relevant content. This results in optimal indexing of all your web pages, images, and documents - not just the homepage.</p>
<p>We will set up your website so that crawlers always find the latest sitemap with all pages, posts, images, and documents.</p>
